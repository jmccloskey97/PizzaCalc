# PizzaCalc
A simple C program that takes in a file and identifies the most cost-effective pizza one can order from the file. The program outputs a number of lines equal to the number of pizzas, and each line is the pizzaâ€™s name and pizza-per-dollar (in2/USD). The lines are sorted in descending order of pizza-per-dollar, and pizzas with equal pizza-per-dollar are sorted alphabetically
